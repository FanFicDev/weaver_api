			<p>
				Depending on which domain the service is accessed through, there may
				or may not be a <span class=c>/weaver</span> prefix to these endpoints.
			</p>
			<p>
				<span class=c>/weaver/v0/remote</span>: Returns the client's remote
				address as seen by weaver. This is not json encoded -- it is a raw
				string. Ex:
			</p>
			<p class=c>127.0.0.1</p>
			<p>
				<span class=c>/weaver/v0/status</span>: Returns the status of the
				service, as well as the client's current burst request limit. If
				everything is well <span class=c>err</span> should be
				<span class=c>0</span> and <span class=c>status</span> should be
				<span class=c>"ok"</span>. Ex:
			</p>
			<p class=c>
				{"burst":4,"err":0,"pid":101844,"status":"ok","tident":140189852665600}
			</p>
			<p>
				<span class=c>/weaver/v0/ffn/crawl?q={url}[&amp;apiKey={key}]</span>:
				Crawl an ffn specific url. Url has <span class=c>http://</span>
				rewritten to <span class=c>https://</span>, and the bare domain is
				rewritten to <span class=c>www.</span>. It is an error to pass a url
				that does not start with
				<span class=c>https://(m|www).(ffn's domain)</span>. If a
				valid <span class=c>apiKey</span> argument is not passed, then a
				aggressively rate limited anonymous one is used. If an
				<span class=c>apiKey</span> <em>is</em> passed, it should be passed in
				the request body.
			</p>
			<p>
				In general, if a response has a negative <span class=c>err</span> code
				in a json body then there was an error issued by the api codebase. If
				there is a positive <span class=c>err</span> code in a json body, then
				the error was issued by the application framework or web server and
				the numeric value will match the http status code.
			<p>
				<span class=c>status 200</span>: body is simply proxied body. A few
				informative headers starting with <span class=c>X-Weaver-</span> are
				included to identify the cached request and actually queried url.
				Upstream response headers are not included.</p>
			<p>
				<span class=c>status 400</span>: bad query, either missing the
				<span class=c>q</span> query param or it is not a supported url. A json
				response body will be included, ex:
			</p>
			<p class=c>{"err":-1,"msg":"missing q param"}</p>
			<p class=c>{"arg":"foo","err":-2,"msg":"url is not ffn"}</p>
			<p>
				<span class=c>status 401</span>: unauthorized, ensure any required
				basic auth parameters are being passed. Ex:
			</p>
			<p class=c>{"err":401,"msg":"Unauthorized","nginx":true}</p>
			<p>
				<span class=c>status 404</span>: file not found, ensure the url is a
				valid api endpoint. Ex:
			</p>
			<p class=c>{"err":-404,"msg":"not found"}</p>
			<p>
				<span class=c>status 429</span>: too many requests; a
				<span class=c>Retry-After</span> header will be included with minimum
				integer number of seconds before the client should make another
				request. A json response body with the same field will be included,
				ex:
			</p>
			<p class=c>{"err":-429,"msg":"too many requests","retryAfter":5}</p>
			<p>
				<span class=c>status 500</span>: internal server error. Either weaver
				is misconfigured, or there's an outage somewhere in the pipeline
				(possibly all FR instances are busy or down).
