weaver_api is a thin interface over skitter_api providing rate limiting and
other restrictions.

Ensure you create a valid etc/nginx/auth/weaver.htpasswd file.

/etc/hosts on the deploy target should contain an entry for polaris.fanfic.dev

Copy priv.ex.py to priv.py and actually fill it with valid credentials.
